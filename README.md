# Movie-Recommendation-system
This is a Python-based movie recommendation model based on the similarity score of the genre, plot, and overview of the movie.
we have created a similarity matrix based on the similarity score of the movie between 0 and 1
where 0 means least matching and 1 means exact match.

Then we created a function that takes the movie name from the user and finds similar movies based on the similarity score
